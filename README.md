# Min  | Finances

My humble version of a finance dashboard, project was great to pratice typescript (specially implementin third libraries for pretty much everything). I`ve used **Zorg** for the forms, Axios for the request and **json-server** to host a fake api. The Modal was made using Zorg and the form thought axios and json-server as a fake api create a new transaction in the ***server.json*** file.

At the top, a summary display shows the values of the current query. This means that when you search for something on the list, the values will change accordingly.
